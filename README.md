Entry for the 2013 Informatics 1 Functional programming competition.

Must be compiled/run with the flag `-XExistentialQuantification`

I am not working with OpenGL's vector type for as much of this program as I
can, as my grasp of monads is shaky at best, and that of OpenGL even worse.

Several tutorials have aided in the making of this program:
